# VB6ProjectParser
VB6 project parser and analysis tool

First go at assessing best methods for parsing VB6 project, modules and class files.  There is no analysis or reporting created yet, just loading and extracting the project definitions.

This is a tool to help me asses the data models and data types represented in a bunch of legacy VB6 code, with plans to maybe automate creation of skeleton C# classes representing them in the future.

Note that this applies to data and business model DLLs, no attention has been given to forms or third party components.
